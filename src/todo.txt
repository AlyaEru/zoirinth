add randomness
- make a file gameConstants to hold these values
- maze windyness
- chance of destroying wall
- chance of killing clover in zoid
- random wait before portal spawn
- randomly spawn superpods

shield mode should stay on per level

mines
- number of mine spawns should increase per level (no mines level 1)

I think zoids are supposed to push traps

add superpods

hyperspace (random teleport)

invisible mode

black holes
