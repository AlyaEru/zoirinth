add randomness
- maze windyness
- chance of destroying wall
- chance of killing clover in zoid
- random wait before portal spawn
- randomly spawn superpods

bug: points resetting to 10 when entering next level

zoidrones
- I'm thinking, be a zoid, but instead of moving each turn has a chance of becoming zoid? 
	this would slow down zoids if there are zoidrones.
- Maybe, a separate entity that also has a spot in the actor cycle. So if there are more zoidrones they take longer to become zoids, but they don't affect zoid speed.

mines
- random spawn
- destroying stuff
- random blow up
- setting them off (shooting, running into them)

more complex zoid AI
- zoids shooting
- preferring unexplored territory
- track left, track right?
- chasing the player
- shooting to escape being trapped
