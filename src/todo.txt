add randomness
- make a file gameConstants to hold these values
- maze windyness
- chance of destroying wall
- chance of killing clover in zoid
- random wait before portal spawn
- randomly spawn superpods

bug: when zoids lay zoidrones/mines they appear as zoidrones/mines until zoid moves
- make it lay behind itself rather than under itself? or lay under itself right before moving?

shield mode should stay on per level

zoids can drop clovers

mines
- running into mines: shield vs. no shield
- number of mine spawns should increase per level

more complex zoid AI
- preferring unexplored territory
- track left, track right?
- chasing the player
- shooting to escape being trapped


hyperspace (random teleport)

big explode

invisible mode

traps

black holes
